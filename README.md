OpenHomePy - Heat Controller
==============================

A connected device for [OpenHomePy](https://github.com/gregor2004ua/openhomepy/) implemented on [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/).

Photon connects to the hub(Raspberry PI) over WIFI and uses MQTT protocol for communication. This device is used to control a radiant floor heating system, it controls 3 heating zones and a water pump. The user is able to turn on heat in any or all of the 3 heating zones, the pump is turned on automatically if any of the heating zones are on, the pump has delayed on function, allowing each zone valve to completely open before the pump starts operating.
